1. General information

This repository contains python codes and parts of input data for generating a regionalized ecoinvent used in the following publication:

Title: A novel approach to regionalizing life cycle inventory with multiregional input-output data: an example of ecoinvent with Exiobase

The folder "Codes" contains the regionalization algorithm. It includes three subfolders for importing databases, integrating databases, and conduting LCA analysis. The folder "Data" contains some input data and prepared subfolders for output data. 
The general status of the model has to be considered "under development" as it runs reliably but it has not been cleaned and improved for ease of access under all potential circumstances.

4. Hardware requirements

Many parts of the algorithm can be run on conventional laptop/ stationary computers within a reasonable time frame. Integrating two databases (2_3_regionalize_ecoinvent_by_iot.ipynb) however requires substantial computational power or a large amount of time. It is therefore strongly recommended to also use server to run this part of the algorithm. These are the specifications of the server that has been used to run the model:

System Manufacturer: FUJITSU
System Model: PRIMERGY RX2540 M4
BIOS: V5.0.0.12 R1.22.0 for D3384-A1x
Processor: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6154 @ 3.00GHz (72 CPUs)
Memory: 377GiB RAM
Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS

----------------------------

5. Software requirements

The code is written in the programming language Python (Version 3.6.13 from 2021-2-15). The authors used the user-firendly interface of the free software Jupyter Notebook (Version 6.4.3) to write and edit the code. As such, it is necessary to install the Jupyter Notebook interface. The installation details can be found here (https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html). 

Package Brightway2 has to be installed in order to run the code successfully. The introduction and installation of the package can be found here (https://documentation.brightway.dev/en/latest/source/setup/setup.html).

----------------------------

6. Model structure

The general structure of the regionalization algorithm is shown in the publication Figure 1 []. More technical details are introduced in the main notebook, i.e., 2_3_regionalize_ecoinvent_by_iot.ipynb.

----------------------------

7. Obtaining and placing the input data

The input data required to run the full model are listed below. Ecoinvent and Exiobase data need to be obtained and stored in the right format and with the right name in the right folder. The rest data are local, some of which are obtained from online sources and modified mannually regarding the region names.


Input data to be obtained:

8. Welcome contributions

Even though the model and its outputs have been carefully tested and reviewed, it is possible that it contains errors or could be improved for ease of use and efficiency of calculation. The authors highly value such input and therefore welcome to open issues at github and welcome any bug reports or suggestions that are submitted to sipeng@ethz.ch. In case the model is updated, it will be shown at github under an updated version number. A list of changes between versions will be included in the file "Readme.txt".
